<!--
1. Start with the HTML5 document type declaration.
2. Add a root element containing head and body sections,
with a link element pointing to a style sheet.
3. Within the body section, insert a heading.
4. Next, insert a captioned figure.
Always refer to figures only by their label - avoid using reference
terms like "in the figure on the right" so the document layout can be
easily changed without creating confusion.
5. Now, insert text content that makes reference to the previous
captioned figure.
6. Insert a second captioned figure.
7. Now, insert text content that makes reference to the second
captioned figure.
Refer to:
    figure.css
