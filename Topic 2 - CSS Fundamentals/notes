Chapter 1:
1.	Introducing CSS
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language used to control the presentation of elements within HyperText Markup
Language (HTML) documents. Presentation is specified by "styles" that may be assigned "inline" to HTML element style
attributes, or by "rules" within <style> </style> tags in the HTML document's head section, or as rules within
separate style sheets.
Each style rule selects specified elements then applies specified styles to them. The W3C is an international
consortium whose members work together to develop web standards. The CSS home page can be found on the W3C website
at: http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS
CSS was created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to regain control of document markup as HTML grew from the
initial few "tags" that merely defined the structural elements of a document – headings, paragraphs, hyperlinks,
and lists.
As further tags were added controlling images, text color, font size, and background color, it became recognized
that the source code of many web pages often contained a great deal of markup for very little actual content.
The W3C offered a solution to regain control of document markup by separating their structural and presentational
aspects. HTML tags would continue to control the structure but presentational aspects would now be contolled by
"style rules" written in the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) language. Besides distinguishing between structural and
presentational aspects of a document, the CSS solution brings these additional benefits:
	1. Easier Maintenance:
	A single style sheet can control multiple HTML documents, so changing appearance across an entire website is
	possible by editing just one style sheet.
	2. Smaller File Sizes:
	Removal of all presentational markup from HTML produces smaller files, which download faster.
	3. Greater Control:
	Margins, borders, padding, background color, and background images to any HTML element, and the appearance of
	certain parts of the interface, such as the cursor, can now be specified.
The CSS level 3 specification (CSS3) is divided into modules that allow enhancements such as rounded borders,
drop-shadows, gradient color-fills, and animation effects.

2.	Understanding the Cascade
The term "Cascading" in CSS describes the manner in which style rules can fall from one style sheet to another.
The cascade determines which style rule will have precedence over others and be the one applied to the selected HTML
element.
There are other style sheet languages, such as the eXtensible Stylesheet Language (XSL), but CSS is by far the most
popular style sheet language.
There are three basic types of style sheet that can specify style rules to be applied to HTML elements:
	1. Browser (Default) Style Sheet:
	Browsers employ an intrinsic set of style rules that they apply to all web pages by default.
	These vary slightly between different browsers but all have common features, such as black text and
	blue hyperlinks.
	2. User Style Sheet:
	Most browsers allow the user to specify their own appearance preferences, which effectively creates a custom
	style sheet that overrides the browser's default style sheet.
	3. Author Style Sheet:
	Where the HTML document specifies a style sheet created by the web page author, the browser will apply the
	style rules it contains, overriding both the user style sheet and the default browser style sheet.
So the cascade means that the browser will typically:
	Apply the style rules in an author style sheet, if present.
	Otherwise, it will apply the style rules in a user style sheet, if present.
	Otherwise, it will apply the style rules in the browser's style sheet by default.

3.	Creating Style Rules
In CSS, each style rule is comprised of TWO main parts:
	1. Selector – specifying which element/s of the HTML document are the target of that rule.
	2. Declaration Block – specifying how properties of the selected target element should be styled.
A style rule (or "style rule set") begins with the selector, followed by the declaration block within a pair of
curly brackets (braces). The braces contain one or more declarations that each specify a property and a valid value
for that property, as in this example:
	Selector: h1
		{Declaration Block}
		Property: Value; Property: Value
Typically the selector targets (selects) a particular HTML element for styling – such as all <h1> heading elements
in the document using the style rule set example above.
The declaration block in the example above contains two declarations to determine the foreground and background
colors of the selected target elements. The CSS color property is assigned a blue value – so each <h1> heading
element will have blue foreground text. Similarly, the CSS background property is assigned a yellow value – so each
<h1> heading element will have a yellow background.
In conformance with the CSS specifications, the examples listed throughout this book do not add a semi-colon
terminator after the final declaration in a declaration block.
Notice how the CSS declaration uses a : colon character to assign a value to a property. Notice also that it
requires the declarations to be separated by a ; semi-colon character.
The final declaration in the declaration block does not need to be terminated by a semi-colon. However, some web
page authors prefer to habitually terminate all CSS declarations so they need not remember to add a separating
semi-colon when adding further declarations to an existing style rule set:
	1. When creating a new CSS style rule the author must initially specify a selector to target the HTML element
	to which the rule will be applied – strictly speaking, the CSS selector is everything that appears before the
	opening brace of the declaration block: h1
	2. Next the declaration block must be created by adding a pair of braces after the selector: h1 {}
Whitespace (spaces, tabs, line feeds, and carriage returns) is permitted within style rule sets to allow the author
to format the style rules to their own preference. Typically style rule sets with fewer than four declarations are
written on a single line, otherwise they are written across multiple lines for clarity.
	3. Now a declaration can be inserted within the declaration block to assign a value to a property:
		h1 {color: blue}
	4. A second declaration can then be added within the declaration block, separated from the first by a
	semi-colon:
		h1 {color: blue; background: yellow}
	5. The style rule set is now complete but can also be applied to another HTML element by extending the selector
	to become a comma-separated list:
		h1, h2 {color: blue; background: yellow}
	6. Further style rule sets can then be added below the first style rule set to target other elements:
		h1, h2 {color: blue; background: yellow}
		p {color : red}

4.	Applying Internal Style Rules
A style sheet is simply a collection of style rule sets to be applied to an HTML document. An internal style sheet
can be created by inserting the style rule sets between <style> and </style> tags in the head section of the HTML
document.
The opening <style> tag should include a type attribute assigned a MIME type of "text/css" to describe the style
sheet as using the CSS language. Optionally, this tag may also include a media attribute assigned a "screen" value
to specifically describe the viewing medium as a color computer screen – although this is the default value if the
media attribute is omitted.
MIME (Multipart Internet Mail Extension) types describe file types:
	text/html for HTML files,
	text/javascript for scripts,
	text/css for style sheets.
All modern web browsers support CSS but if you wish to hide the internal style sheet from older browsers the style
rule sets can be enclosed within <!-- and --> HTML comment tags.

Refer to:
internal.html

5.	Linking an External Style Sheet
An external style sheet style is simply a collection of style rule sets listed
in a plain text file, such as those created by Windows' Notepad application, then
saved with a ".css" file extension. The style sheet can then be linked to HTML
documents using a <link> tag. This must include a type attribute assigned a MIME
type of "text/css" to denote using the CSS language, a rel attribute assigned a
"stylesheet" relationship value, and an href attribute assigned the path to the
style sheet file. Optionally, this tag may also include a media attribute assigned
a "screen" value to describe the viewing medium as a color computer screen –
although this is the default value if the media attribute is omitted.

Refer to:
external1.html
&
external2.html

6.	Importing other Style Sheets
Multiple external style sheets can be used to control different aspects of HTML
documents using @import directives to specify the path to each CSS file. These
must be placed before any other rules in the style sheet and be terminated by a
semi-colon.

Refer to:
import.html
import.css
headings.css
paragraphs.css

7.	Summary
• CSS is a language provided by the W3C to regain control of markup by separating
document structure from presentation.
• The cascade allows style rules to fall from one style sheet to another and
determines which style rule will be applied.
• Each style rule comprises of a selector and a declaration block.
• Each declaration specifies a property and a value to be applied to that property,
separated by a : colon character.
• A style rule set contains multiple declarations, each separated from the next by
a ; semi-colon character.
• The final declaration in a declaration block need not be terminated with a ;
semi-colon character.
• An internal style sheet is a collection of style rules contained within
<style> </style> tags in the head section of an HTML document.
• Style rules can also be applied inline by assigning properties and values to the
style attribute of an HTML element.
• Inline style rules are difficult to maintain and should be avoided.
• External style sheets are recommended to cleanly separate structure and
presentation – internal style sheets should only be created in special
circumstances.
• An external style sheet is a collection of style rule sets listed in a plain
text file saved with a .css file extension.
• An HTML document can link an external style sheet file by adding a <link>
element in the document's head section.
• Each <link> element must contain rel, type, and href attributes.
• The MIME type of CSS is text/css.
• All @import directives must appear before other rules in a style sheet and must
be terminated with a ; semi-colon character.

Chapter 2: Selecting Targets
	Selecting by Element Type
The selector part of a style rule selects elements in an HTML document to be
styled according to the values specified in that rule's Declaration Block.
A "type" selector selects all elements in the page that match the selector.
Multiple elements can be selected by a type selector that specifies a
comma-separated list of element types.
1. Create an HTML document containing a heading and an unordered list of
hyperlinks within a "div" container:
<div>
	<h1>Large Heading</h1>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="www.google.com">Google</a></li>
		<li><a href="www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a></li>
		<li><a href="www.mediafire.com">MediaFire</a></li>
	</ul>
</div>
2. Create a linked style sheet with a style rule setting the width of the
container element:
div {width: 50%}
3. Add a style rule setting the background color of all hyperlinks
a {background: yellow}
4. Now add a style rule setting the background color of both the heading and
list elements:
h1, ul {background: aqua}
5. Save the style sheet file alongside the HTML file then open the web page in a
browser to see the elements styled by type selectors.
The CSS * universal selector can be used to select elements of all types within
an HTML document – as if it was a selector listing all element types as a
comma-separated list.
6. Edit the style sheet by adding a style rule with a universal selector to make
all text italic:
* {font-style: italic}
Beware: Remember that there must be a comma between the element types in a
selector targeting multiple element types.
7. Save the amended style sheet then refresh the browser to see both heading and
list text become italic.
The * universal selector can also be used to select elements of any type
contained within a specified element type.
8. Edit the style sheet by adding a style rule with a universal selector to add
a border around all elements within the "div" container:
div * {border: 0.2em solid red}
9. Save the amended style sheet then refresh the browser once more to see borders
added around the elements.
The div * selector selects elements of all types within the div container, but
not the <div> element itself.

	Selecting by Class
As an alternative to selecting elements by type, a class selector can select HTML
elements that contain a class attribute that has been assigned a value matching
the selector. The class selector begins with a period character followed by the
class value to match. This is especially useful to apply the style rule across a
number of specific elements of different type.
Additionally a class selector can be combined with a type selector to select
specific instances of a class. In this case the selector first specifies the
element type, followed by a period character and the class value to match.
1. Create an HTML document containing a paragraph including two spanned words, in
which all elements have a common class value:
<p class="frame">You can fool all the people
<span class="frame">some</span> of the time, and
<span class="frame">some</span> of the people all the
time, but you cannot fool all the people all of the time.</p>
TOPIC2class.html
2. Create a linked style sheet with a style rule drawing red borders around each
element using the class value:
.frame { border : 0.2em solid red }
TOPIC2class.css
3. Now add a rule overriding the previous one for the paragraph element only, to
draw a blue border around the paragraph and set its width:
p.frame { border : 0.2em solid blue; width : 50% }
Other paragraphs added to this HTML document would not be styled with this style
sheet – unless they too contained a class attribute with the value of "frame".
4. Save the style sheet file alongside the HTML document then open the web page
in a browser to see the elements styled by the class selectors.

	Selecting by Identity
Similar to a class selector, an ID selector can select HTML elements that contain
an id attribute that has been assigned a value matching the selector. The ID
selector begins with a # hash character followed by the ID value to match. This is
mostly useful to apply the style rule to one specific element as each id attribute
value must be unique within the HTML document.
Optionally an ID selector can be combined with a type selector simply to identify
the element type. In this case the selector first specifies the element type,
followed by a hash character and the ID value to match.
1. Create an HTML document containing a paragraph including two spanned phrases,
in which all elements have a unique ID value:
<p id="para1">You may only be someone
<span id="span1">in the world</span><br>
but to someone else you may
<span id="span2">be the world</span></p>
TOPIC2id.html
2. Create a linked style sheet with style rules painting colored backgrounds
behind the text in each span element:
#span1 { background : yellow }
#span2 { background : lime }
TOPIC2id.css
3. Now add a style rule to paint a colored background behind the rest of the
paragraph and set its width:
p#para1 { background : cyan; width : 70% }
4. Save the style sheet file alongside the HTML document then open the web page
in a browser to see the elements styled by the ID selectors.
If a class selector and an ID selector both attempt to style the same property of
one element the ID selector value would be applied as it takes preference.

	Selecting Descendants
A descendant selector can be used in a style rule to select HTML elements by
reference to an outer containing element from which they "descend". For example,
a span element within a paragraph element descends from the paragraph element –
so a descendant selector of p span could be used to select it for styling.
1. Create an HTML document containing an unordered list and an ordered list
within a "div" container:
<div id="menu">
	<ul>
		<li>Bigger Burger</li>
		<li>Buffalo Wings</li>
		<li>Deepcrust Pizza</li>
	</ul>
	<ol>
		<li>Cola</li>
		<li>Beer</li>
	</ol>
</div>
TOPIC2descendants.html
2. Create a linked style sheet with style rules to color the items in each list:
ul li {color: red}
ol li {color: blue}
TOPIC2descendants.css
3. Save the style sheet alongside the HTML document then open the web page in a
browser to see the list items styled by descendant selectors.
Although it is generally preferable to reference the element from which the target
element directly descends it is sometimes useful to simply reference a higher
level – say, that from which the containing element descends. This means that the
direct containing element is omitted from the selector and the element is selected
by reference to the higher level containing element.
4. Edit the style sheet by replacing the previous style rules with a single rule
to color the items of both lists in a single color:
#menu li {color: green}
5. Save the amended style sheet then refresh the browser window to see the list
items styled without reference to their direct containing elements.
In this case a descendant selector of div li would also select all list items
but it is better to reference the id value so as not to select list items in
other div elements.
More specific selection can be made, however, by stating each containing element
in the line of descent in a descendant selector.
6. Edit the style sheet once more by replacing the previous style rule with two
style rules to color the items of both lists in different colors:
#menu ul li {color: orange}
#menu ol li {color: purple}
7. Save the newly-amended style sheet then refresh the browser window again to
see the list items styled by reference to their lines of descent.
State the line of descent wherever possible when using descendant selectors to
make specific selections.

	Selecting by Relationship
Style rules can select elements for styling using the HTML document structure
itself. The elements in all HTML documents are arranged in a hierarchical manner
descending from the root <html> element. The next level contains the <head> and
<body> elements. These each contain nested elements that may, in turn, contain
further nested elements, and so on to complete the hierarchy. The hierarchy of a
simple HTML document could resemble this tree view:
This tree view represents the HTML document in the example opposite.
The hierarchy between a containing element and a nested element on the next
hierarchical level can be described as a parent-child relationship. So <html> is
the parent of the <head> and <body> elements, who are themselves children of the
<html> element. Similarly, the <head> element is the parent of the <meta>, <title>
and <link> child elements, and the <h3>, <p>, and <ul> elements are all children
of the <body> parent element.
A style rule child selector can select specific child elements by stating the
parent name followed by the > right angled-bracket character then the child name.
For example, a child selector of p > span selects all span elements within
paragraph elements.
As with people, all elements are a parent or a child, or in many cases they are
both.
The child selector can even state the hierarchy completely back to the root
element if preferred, such as html > body > p > span.
Another selector that selects elements by relationship is the adjacent sibling
selector. This selects the first sibling element after a specified element – by
stating the specified element name followed by the + plus character then the
sibling name. For example, an adjacent sibling selector of h3 + p selects any
<p> paragraph element that immediately follows a <h3> heading element where both
have the same parent.
1. Create an HTML document containing a heading, two paragraphs, a list, and
including two spanned phrases:
<body>
	<h3>Heading : Child</h3>
	<p>Paragraph : Child</p>
	<p>Paragraph : Child
	<span>Span : Grandchild</span></p>
	<ul>
		<li>List Item : Grandchild</li>
		<li>List Item : Grandchild
		<span>Span : Great Grandchild</span></li>
	</ul>
</body>
TOPIC2relationship.html
2. Create a linked style sheet with a style rule to select the first sibling
immediately following the heading:
h3 + p {background: yellow}
TOPIC2relationship.css
3. Next add a style rule to select the span child of the paragraph element:
p > span {background: lime}
4. Now add style rules to select in turn each descendant element in the list by
describing its hierarchy:
body > ul {background: fuchsia}
body > ul > li {background: aqua}
body > ul > li > span {background: orange}
5. Save the style sheet alongside the HTML document then open the web page in a
browser to see the elements styled by sibling and child selectors.
The text in this example describes each element's relationship to the <body>
element.

	Selecting by Attribute
Style rules can select HTML elements for styling by matching an attribute that
the element contains. The selector in this case specifies the attribute name
within square brackets. For example, a selector of *[src] would select all
elements containing a src attribute – irrespective of their assigned values.
Additionally, the attribute selector can specify multiple attributes to select
only those elements containing all the specified attributes. For example, a
selector of *[src][alt] would select all elements containing both src and alt
attributes – irrespective of their assigned values.
More specific selection is possible by stating an assigned value to match in the
selector. For example, a selector of *[lang = "en"] would select all elements
containing a lang attribute that have an assigned value of "en".
1. Create an HTML document with five anchor elements:
<div>
	<a id="top">Anchor</a>
</div><hr>

<div>
	<a href="http://www.google.com">Web Hyperlink</a>
</div><hr>

<div>
	<a href="http://www.google.com" title="Google">
              Web Hyperlink + Title</a>
</div><hr>

<div>
	<a href="#top" title="Top of the Page" >
                        Page Hyperlink</a>
</div><hr>

<div>
	<a id="bottom">Anchor</a>
</div>
TOPIC2attribute.html
2. Create a linked style sheet with a style rule to paint the background of all
anchors containing an id attribute:
a[id] {background: orange}
TOPIC2attribute.css
3. Add a style rule text to color the text in all hyperlinks containing an href
attribute:
a[href] {color: red}
4. Next add a style rule to paint the background of all hyperlinks containing
both an href attribute and a title attribute:
a[href][title] {background: yellow}
5. Now add a style rule to draw a border around all hyperlinks that have an href
attribute assigned a #top value:
a[href="#top"] {border: 0.2em solid blue}
6. Save the style sheet alongside the HTML document then open the web page in a
browser to see styles applied to elements selected by their attributes.
The * "wild card" universal selector selects all elements that match.

	Selecting Partial Attributes
Style rules can select HTML elements for styling by matching partial attribute
values. This allows the selector to target an element based upon the presence of
any single word in an attribute containing a space-separated list of words.
Typically, this technique might be used to match one of the words assigned to the
class attribute of an HTML element.
Beware: Do not insert a space in the ~= or |= syntax.
The syntax to match a single word in an attribute list adds a ~ tilde character
to the selector, such as *[class ~= "word"] – to match all elements that have a
class attribute assigned a "word" value.
Additionally, a style rule selector can select an HTML element for styling by
matching the beginning of an assigned attribute value. Typically, this technique
might be used to match values assigned to HTML lang attribute values or a series
of images.
The syntax to match the beginning of a value assigned to an HTML attribute adds a
| pipe character to the selector, such as *[lang |= "es"] – to match all elements
that have a lang attribute assigned a value beginning with "es".
1. Create an HTML document containing an ordered list in which all elements have
a class attribute:
<ol>
<li class="reptile">Alligator</li>
<li class="animal">Race Horse</li>
<li class="animal">Domestic Cat</li>
<li class="fish">Barracuda</li>
<li class="toy animal">Teddy Bear</li>
</ol>
TOPIC2partial.html
2. Add an unordered list in which all elements have a lang attribute:
<ul>
<li lang="en-us">Hello America</li>
<li lang="es">Hola España</li>
<li lang="es-mx">Hola México</li>
</ul>
3. Add a paragraph containing two sets of images:
<p>
<img src="ring-1.png" alt="Ring Image">
<img src="box-1.png" alt="Box Image">
<img src="ring-2.png" alt="Ring Image">
<img src="box-2.png" alt="Box Image">
<img src="ring-3.png" alt="Ring Image">
<img src="box-3.png" alt="Box Image">
</p>
4. Save the HTML file, then create a style sheet with a rule to select elements
in the ordered list according to the value assigned to their class attributes:
*[class ~= "animal"] {background: lime}
TOPIC2partial.css
5. Now add a rule to select elements in the unordered list according to the
beginning of the value assigned to their lang attributes:
*[lang |= "es"] {color: red; background: yellow}
6. Next add rules to select img elements according to the beginning of the value
assigned to their src attributes:
*[src |= "ring"] {background: fuchsia}
*[src |= "box"] {background: aqua}
7. Save the style sheet alongside the HTML document then open the web page in a
browser to see styles applied by selecting partial attribute values.

	Evaluating Importance
After the cascade considers the origin of style rules, as described on page 11,
the browser then evaluates their "weight" to determine which rules have most
weight and should, therefore, be applied.
Weight can be added to any style rule by including a CSS !important declaration
to elevate its status. For example, the rule h2 {color: red !important} takes
precedence over another rule of h2 {color: blue} and the red color will be
applied.
Don't Forget: The * wildcard selector has a zero specificity value of 0,0,0,0.
Although regular Author style sheet rules take precedence over regular User and
Browser style sheet rules, an !important User style sheet rule overrides an
!important Author style sheet rule. So the cascade sorts style sheet rules by
origin and weight into this order, from most weight to least weight:
1. !important User style sheet rules
2. !important Author style sheet rules
3. regular Author style sheet rules
4. regular User style sheet rules
5. regular Browser style sheet rules
Where more than one style rule of equal weight targets properties of the same
element the browser then evaluates their importance by examining their selector's
"specificity" – to consider how specifically each one targets the element. The
specificity evaluation process awards points for each selector component, which
get stored in four "registers" for later comparison against the specificity value
of conflicting selectors. So the specificity value can be expressed as a
comma-separated list – in which 0,0,0,0 is a zero specificity value. The selector
component points are awarded like this:
1. For each element and pseudo-element in the selector add 0,0,0,1
2. For each class attribute value, attribute selection, or pseudo-class in the
selector add 0,0,1,0
3. For each id attribute in the selector add 0,1,0,0
4. For inline style attribute declarations add 1,0,0,0
In comparing specificity values the registers are examined individually, reading
from left to right, until a difference is found. The style rule with the highest
value in that register is then applied, For example, in comparing specificity
values of 0,1,0,0 and 0,0,0,1 a difference occurs in the second register.
1. Create an HTML document containing three headings:
<h2>Element style</h2>
<h2 id="heading-2">Identity style</h2>
<h2 class="headers">Class style</h2>
TOPIC2importance.html
2. Next create a linked style sheet containing rules that both target the heading elements' color property:
h2 {color: yellow !important}
h2 {color: black}
TOPIC2importance.css
3. Now add rules that each target the heading elements' background property in
different ways:
h2 {background: aqua}               /* 0,0,0,1 */
body h2 {background: blue}          /* 0,0,0,2 */

#heading-2 {background: maroon}     /* 0,1,0,0 */
h2#heading-2 {background: red}      /* 0,1,0,1 */

h2.headers {background: olive}      /* 0,0,1,1 */
body h2.headers {background: green} /* 0,0,1,2 */
4. Save the style sheet alongside the HTML document then open the web page in a
browser to see the elements styled after considering origin, weight, and
specificity.
